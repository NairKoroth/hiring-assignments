Dear Candidate,

Congratulations on making it to the next round of our internship selection process! We've designed three assignments that will help us understand your approach to business development and communication. Please choose any TWO of the following assignments.

## Assignment Option 1: LinkedIn Outreach Campaign
**Objective:** Design a mini LinkedIn outreach campaign to generate leads for Othor AI's business intelligence solution.

### Tasks:
1. Create 3 different LinkedIn connection request messages (300 characters max each) targeting:
   * A Chief Data Officer at a mid-sized tech company
   * A Head of Business Intelligence at a retail company
   * A VP of Analytics at a financial services firm

2. Write a follow-up message (600 characters max) to send after the connection is accepted

3. Provide a brief explanation (200-300 words) of:
   * Why you chose your specific messaging approach
   * How you would measure the success of this campaign
   * What criteria you would use to select potential leads on LinkedIn

## Assignment Option 2: Competitive Analysis Presentation
**Objective:** Create a brief competitive analysis focusing on how to position Othor AI against traditional BI tools.

   * 3 specific customer pain points that Othor AI solves better than the competitor
   * A simple cold call script highlighting these advantages (30-45 seconds when read aloud)

2. Include speaker notes explaining your rationale for each point

## Assignment Option 3: Event Networking Simulation
**Objective:** Demonstrate your ability to engage with potential clients in a virtual networking setting.

### Tasks:
